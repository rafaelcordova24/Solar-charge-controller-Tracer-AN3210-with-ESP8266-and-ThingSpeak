# Solar-charge-controller-Tracer-AN3210-with-ESP8266-and-ThingSpeak
This repository has the code for reading the information of voltage, current and power from a solar controller Tracer AN3210. The data is send to ThingSpeak through an ESP8266 and some calculations are performed online using Matlab code.
The specific calcultations used Matlab are the calculation of power from current and voltage and its graph vs. the time (in UTC+0 time)
